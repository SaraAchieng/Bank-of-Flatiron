## Instructions

For this project, youâ€™ll be building out a React application that displays a
list of your recent bank transactions, among other features.

Part of what this code challenge is testing is your ability to follow given
instructions. While you will definitely have a significant amount of freedom in
how you implement the features, be sure to carefully read the directions for
setting up the application.


Make sure to open
[http://localhost:8000/transactions](http://localhost:8001/transactions) in the
browser to verify that your backend is working before you proceed!

The app uses [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) for styling.



## Endpoints

The base URL for your backend is: `http://localhost:8000`

## Core Deliverables

As a user, I should be able to:

- See a table of the transactions.
- Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. This should add the new
  transaction to the table **as well as post the new transaction to the backend
  API for persistence**.
- Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a
  description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions
  table.
